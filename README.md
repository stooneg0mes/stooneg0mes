# Howdy! Welcome to my profile.


## About me
Hello, my name is Samuel Gomes. I'm an experienced Java and Kotlin developer and have started programming 5 years ago. In particular, I have experience developing Minecraft plugins using Bukkit and Sponge API.

My passion for software development began when I was still a kid. I've started to look and research by myself and got instantly hooked. I found it fascinating to be able to create something out of nothing using just a keyboard and a screen. Since then, I have never looked back and have dedicated my career to becoming the best developer that I can be.

I'm always seeking to expand my knowledge and skills in software development, and I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow. I'm a firm believer in the power of collaboration and teamwork.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to get something done.
