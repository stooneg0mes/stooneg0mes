## About me
Hello, my name is Samuel Gomes. I'm an experienced Java and Kotlin developer and have started programming 5 years ago. In particular, I have experience developing Minecraft plugins using Bukkit and Sponge API.

My passion for software development began when I was still a kid. I've always liked things such computers and games, but when I started looking into programming, I got instantly hooked with the idea that I could be a person that actually creates these things.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to get something done.
