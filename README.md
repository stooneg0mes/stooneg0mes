## Hey there!
I'm Samuel Gomes. I've been working as a Java and Kotlin developer for the past 5 years. During this time I've gained expertise in crafting Minecraft plugins using Bukkit and Sponge API.

My journey into software development began back when I was just a kid. I've always had a fondness for computers and games. However once I delved into programming it became a passion of mine. The idea that I could actually create all of these things fascinated me from the get go.

If you have any questions or need to get something made don't hesitate to reach out to me. Lets get things done together!
